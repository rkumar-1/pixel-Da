# pixel-Da

Intro 

C++11 provides thread as an abstraction. This long due support is now evolving into parallel stl in C++17 standard 
and leads to even more parallel processing abstractions in C++20. 

Dancing Pixel project researches application level access to parallel processing on multi-core systems utilizing simple primitives such as 
setting thread affinity to CPU cores and Process affinity.  The goal is to simplify the Application level access to parallel processing through 
a framework. 

The initial build of Dancing pixel (pixel-da) is a simple collection of data strutures that get benchmarked vs stl and parallel stl.
